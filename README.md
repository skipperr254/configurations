# Dev Configurations and Dotfiles

This is where I will be storing my config files and dotfiles for my development, both for Linux and Windows. I will be updating it every time I discover something new and interesting.

## .vimrc
The first file in this config will be the .vimrc file. This is the file that vim will be reading from every time it starts so you can add the pre-configs you would like for your terminal.
